# Propagation-simulation-result-2
The results of numerical FDTD simulations for the paper entitled "Properties of Whistler Wavesâ€™ Ducting in Plasmas
2 With Systems of Small-scale Density Depletions" by Zudin I.Yu. et al.

All files stored here are vectors or matrices coefficients presented in the text format and space symbol separated. "loadtxt" function from "numpy" library can be used for the data loading by a Python user. Each folder corresponds to a figure with the same number.

## Figure2 folder
All files are the solutions of the dispersion equations wrote in the paper. Each of file consist in two columns. First column is the density depletion width $d$ (in meters), and second column is wavenumber $p$.
* "even_0.dat", "even_1.dat" ... are the fist, the second etc. even modes of the plain depletion.
* "odd_0.dat", "odd_1.dat" ... are the fist, the second etc. odd modes of the plain depletion.
* "m=0_0.dat", "m=0_1.dat" ... are the fist, the second etc. brunches of the modes of the cylindrical depletion with azimuth number $m=0$.
* "m=+1_0.dat", "m=+1_1.dat" ... are the fist, second the etc. modes of the cylindrical depletion with azimuth number $m=1$.
* "m=-1_0.dat", "m=-1_1.dat" ... are the fist, second the etc.  modes of the cylindrical depletion with azimuth number $m=-1$.

## Figure3 folder
All files are the dependences of normalized localization scale $\delta/d$ from $d$. Each of file consist in two columns. The first one is the density depletion width $d$ (in meters), and the second column is $p$. The files is named in such a manner as in Figure2 folder.

## Figure5 folder
"Ex.dat", "Ey.dat" and so on are the amplitudes of electric and magnetic field components presented in Figure \#5 of the paper. "Ne.dat" is simulated density profile at z=60 km, as in above the file consists in two columns. The first is the $x$ coordinate and the second is the density. "xgrid.dat" and "zgrid.dat" are Cartesian coordinates of the grid's nodes used for field representation. So Ex(x\[i\],z\[j\])=Ex\[j,i\]

* units of plasma density is "m(-3)"
* units of electrical field components is "mkV/m"
* units of magnetic field components is "pT"
* units of Cartesian coordinates is "km"

The grid used for the data presentation is less detailed than that used for actual simulation.
